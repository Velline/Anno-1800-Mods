### 1 Load First

This is requiered for Eli Rework and Fun Items to work.

### Better Palace

### Better Ships

Increased speed and capacity for ships. (Note: This includes Airships, however most war ships are unaffected by this)

### Better Traders

Traders will have a higher quantity and restock faster. (Note: Some items which are offered by the traders are changed)

### Better Warehouses

Increases the capacity of warehouses and harbors and ther capability to handle multiple incoming products. (Note: The second part is mainly to reduce lags in later game stages by reducing the amount of buildings)

### Cultivation Area Removed

Greatly reduces the amount of space needed to run buildings which requiere cultivation area, for example Lumberjacks. (Note: Using this mod will also decrease the time it takes to grow the plants in order to be able to run the building)

### Easier game

This mod changes the amount of input and output of all production buildings (includes mines) and maybe speeds up the game a little bit. (Note: Later stages of the game requieres you to have different amounts of buildings in order to keep the production chain running, however with this mod enabled you can always go 1:1, except for mines which can run multiple other buildings to make up for the limited amoutn available)
